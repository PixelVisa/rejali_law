					<p>Christopher Nepacena received his Juris Doctor from Thomas Jefferson School of Law and is now serving as a Law Clerk for the Rejali Law Firm. His past legal experiences include working within the public and private sectors. Christopher interned with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) working on government tort liability and eminent domain cases. Christopher also interned with other local law firms where he gained valuable hands on experience working on personal injury, employment litigation, corporate formation and counsel, business litigation, class action defense, creditor claims, trademark, and patent infringement. As a Legal Assistant for a law firm in San Francisco, Christopher also worked on construction defect, mold and other real property litigation, warranty disputes, and statutory payment issues such as mechanics’ liens, stop notices, and public and private bonds.</p>

					<p>While in law school, Christopher participated in the University of San Diego School of Law’s study abroad program, where he studied international litigation and arbitration at the College of Law of England and Wales in London, UK. Christopher was also active in extracurricular activities, serving as the Vice President of his law school’s Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA), and as the Executive Consultant for the Crawford Legal Institute and Mentorship Bond (CLIMB) – a program designed to mentor high school students pursuing a legal career.  Currently, he remains involved in professional organizations such as the American Bar Association (ABA), Filipino American Lawyers of San Diego (FALSD), Pan Asian Lawyers of San Diego (PALSD), and the Korean American Bar Association (KABA).</p>

					<p>Christopher is a native of the Bay Area and received his B.A. from the University of San Francisco where he majored in Political Science and double minored in Legal Studies and Philippine Studies. While in college, Christopher served on the executive board for several student organizations, was an active member of a social justice fraternity, and volunteered his time to local charities throughout the greater Bay Area.</p>

					<p>Christopher hopes to use his education and training as a means of bridging the gap between people’s problems and their solutions. “When there is a will, there is a way.” – Samuel Smiles  </p>
