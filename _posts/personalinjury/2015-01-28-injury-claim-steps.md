### REFUSE TO GIVE A WRITTEN OR RECORDED STATEMENT TO YOUR OWN OR THE OPPOSING SIDES INSURANCE CARRIER

Following an automobile accident, motorcycle accident, slip and fall, pedestrian accident or any other type of accident where an injury has resulted one of the first steps that insurance companies try to do is to obtain the victims recorded or written statement. It is imperative for you to know that the insurance companies DO NOT have your best interest in mind, and if prior to seeking an injury lawyer you are solicited to give such statement you have the absolute right to refuse the insurance companies requests. In reality, all the insurance carriers are trying to do is to strengthen their claim and to use the statements provided by you to deny or lower their liability. So, if you find yourself in such a situation it is best to actually not respond to their phone call, or if you do, remember to refuse their request and end the conversation and immediately seek a personal injury lawyer.  

### REFRAIN FROM DISCUSSING YOUR CLAIM WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN WITH YOUR PERSONAL INJURY ATTORNEY

Do not under any circumstances discuss your case with any person other than your personal injury lawyer. Discussing your case with relatives or friends can have a significant impact on your case as the opposing side may ask them questions relating to the incident and if there are inconsistent statement that have been made, they could significantly impact your claim. This does not include discussing any type of pain, suffering or emotional distress that you have encountered as a result of the accident. So, remember not to discuss the details of what happened during the incident with anyone other than you personal injury attorney. 

### SEEK MEDICAL CARE IMMEDIATELY 

It is very important in every personal injury case for the injured party to seek treatment immediately following the injuries sustained. In addition, any type of gap in treatment would have a negative affect on your personal injury claim. Insurance companies are always looking for reasons to limit a potential claimantâ€™s amount of recovery. The fewer flaws they can find in your case the better chance of a higher recovery. 

### LOST WAGES 

Lost wages are recoverable damages in injury claims once liability has been established. Do not be reluctant to seek all the medical treatment reasonably necessary for your injury claim because you are worried about taking the time off from work. Lost wages are a recoverable component of your injury claim. Make sure that you have fully recovered prior to returning to work. Returning to work prior to being fully recovered could have a damaging effect on your injury claim since it could be argued by the opposing side that you were never actually injured or if you had been injured the extent of your injuries are not as you claim them to be. 

If you have been victim of an auto accident, motorcycle accident, slip and fall, trolley accident, train accident, hit and run accident, you may be entitled to recovery for all of your past, present, and future medical expenses, lost wages, prior emotional distress and pain and suffering, and future emotional distress caused by the perpetrator.
