Best Representation at an Affordable Price

Came to Omid for a civil litigation matter. Told him my problem and he explained to me what my options were. Kept it real and kept me informed about the status of the case. Actually, he gives you access to your case file 24/7 so you can track the progress of your case. Needlessly to say, Omid has not been the only lawyer I have needed to litigate my business matters. However, he does stand out with his representation and outstanding customer service. He even helped a family member with an immigration issue and was able to answer all of her questions and filled out all of the necessary forms. He is also a San Diego native so you can trust that he cares about the rights of fellow San Diegans.
