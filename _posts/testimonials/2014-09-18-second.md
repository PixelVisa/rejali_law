Omid is one of the most knowledgeable and hardworking attorneys in San Diego. His services are pretty affordable too, which helps a ton when you can't afford a lawyer who will probably drag out your case to get paid more. I had a legal matter to deal with and I spoke to several attorneys before I finally came to Omid. He was the only one that kept it real with me. Most attorneys will tell you what you want to hear, but this man tells you what you need to hear. Effective lawyer with effective results. Highly recommended if you need legal advice/representation.
