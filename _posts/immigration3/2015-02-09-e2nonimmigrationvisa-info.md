The E2 nonimmigrant visas are U.S. investment visas that enable an individual to work in the United States of America if he or she makes an investment, which remains under his or her control, while he or she is in the country. This is a visa that is renewed every two years. These U.S. investment visas are only available to citizens of the treaty countries, which do not include India, Brazil, China, or Russia. The treaty can include that of commerce, navigation, or friendship. This has been implemented to promote investment and trade from those countries. Individuals or businesses from these countries are eligible to apply for the E2 non-immigration visas.

The amount of investment required for the non-immigrant visas depend on the type of business or start-up which is being planned. This investment must be substantial enough that the venture is capitalized by it. U.S. investment visa holders must return to their country of origin when the business is concluded. They can stay on in the United States upon changing the status of their visa or obtaining an extension so long as they can show the business is still operational. With the E2 non-immigration visas, dependents of the visa holder can also stay and study in the country, if they are below 21 years of age.

Applications for the E2 nonimmigrant visas should be made at the Consulate or U.S Embassy which has jurisdiction where the applicants permanently reside.
