   		<h4>What do you like most about your job?</h4>
		<p>Vindicating my clients rights. In todays society where our rights are being curtailed day by day, I am very passionate about making sure that the rights that each individual is afforded in this country are fully vindicated. And I will make sure that no stone is left unturned to vindicate those rights.</p>
	</div>

   <div class="item">
   		<h4>What do you wish customers knew about you or your profession?</h4>
		<p>My struggles. I went through a lot of hardships to be where I am today. I faced many setbacks, challenges, barriers, but all of them shaped the person I am today and gave me the strength, confidence, and passion to obtain the best results for my clients.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="item">
   		<h4>How did you decide to get in your line of work?</h4>
		<p>Oh where can I start. I like order and am a bit of a perfectionist. However, the world is not a perfect place. Coming from a family of immigrants and living overseas made me see things differently. I lived in Iran for 10 years and things over there are very different than in the U.S. That made me want to get in this line of work to help people from around the world to move and live in a better place. From the criminal defense stand point, I never felt comfortable with the way our law enforcement conducted their line of work and felt that there should always be a person on the other side protecting the little guy from the government and make sure that their rights are completely vindicated. That's just a short version of why I decided to become an attorney.</p>

   		<h4>What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?</h4>
		<p>When hiring an attorney you want to make sure that first and foremost you feel comfortable with him/her. Often times clients are intimidated by their attorneys. Make sure the attorney answers all of your questions and effectively communicates with you all of your options before making a decision on any legal matter. It is an attorney's duty as a counselor of law to explain to you the law and procedure and provide you with a road map of the steps of your case. Finally, although it is difficult when you first meet with an attorney to know if they are reliable and easy to get a hold of, because the number one complaint from clients against their attorney is that they are not able to get a hold of them.  Make sure you are able to contact your attorney later on if you do decide to hire him/her. You might be able to do some research and make sure that the attorney is generally available to his/her clients, I hope these few tips help you in making an informed decision in hiring the right attorney.</p>

   <div class="item">
   		<h4>If you were a customer, what do you wish you knew about your trade? Any inside secrets to share?</h4>
		<p>Make sure when hiring an attorney that they explain everything to you thoroughly and that most importantly you hire an attorney for which you feel very comfortable with. You should not feel intimidated by your attorney. As your advocate you should feel very comfortable with your attorney so that way you share everything that is relevant to your case with him, so he could obtain the best results possible for you.</p>

   <div class="item">
   		<h4>If you were advising someone who wanted to get into your profession, what would you suggest?</h4>
		<p>If you have a passion for the law it will be a very rewarding field. Also, please do not listen to others when it comes to making personal decisions like becoming an attorney. Ask others to keep their opinions to themselves or just listen to them and then do what you want to do anyways. Don't allow anybody deter you from what you want to do.</p>
