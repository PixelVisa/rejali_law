				<p>Omid Rejali comes from a very dynamic background. As a first generation child of family of immigrants he spent 10 years of his life growing up in Tehran. Living in a third world country has given Omid the ability to appreciate the legal rights our wonderful but not perfect justice system has to offer.</p>
				<p>Omid has a passion for the court room and believes that every individual's rights should be fully vindicated no matter what the circumstances are. His struggles while growing up have made him a very strong person who is able to overcome anything that stands in his way. He is a staunch believer in government transparency and making sure each and every one of his clients' rights are fully vindicated.</p>
				<p>While in law school Omid has won many awards, including The Jefferson Medal, and California Award for Excellence in international business transactions and legal synthesis. He has also been placed on the deans list for his excellent academic performance. Additionally, he received a certificate of achievement from the Pro Bono Honors Program for giving over 200 hours of legal assistance to those in need in the community.</p>
				<p>Prior to opening his firm Omid externed for the Honorable Judge Jack Staton at the Department of Justice, Office of Immigration Review in El Centro where he obtained valuable hands on experience and learned how the immigration court operates. He also gained exposure to the courtroom while working at the El Cajon public defenders office. </p>
				<p>Omid is fluent in speaking Farsi and is licensed to practice in all California State Courts and in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. </p>
