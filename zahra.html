					<p>Ms. Rejali was born and raised in Tehran. While studying in Tehran she finished two years of studying law at Shahid Beheshti University prior to getting married and moving to the United States in 1976.</p>

					<p>While in the United States she had three children and was unable to pursue her dream of studying law. However, her passion for law and justice was always a lingering thought in her mind. Ms. Rejali states that: “Getting acquainted on legal events and the judicial system is part of her life.”</p>

					<p>In 1992 Ms. Rejali and the Rejali family moved back to Tehran. While in Tehran and always pursuing her curiosity in language and knowledge, she received a Bachelors degree in Italian literature and translation from Azad University in 2001.</p>

					<p>After Ms. Rejali’s son, Omid Rejali, Esq., the owner and principal of the REJALI LAW FIRM graduated from law school, Ms. Rejali gathered the impetus to go back to school to obtain her paralegal certificate to fulfill her dream and passion for the law.</p>

					<p>Currently she is a student at Miramar College with one semester left until receiving her paralegal certificate. Furthermore, she has been very involved at the college by being a part of a variety of organizations including the paralegal association at Miramar College.</p>

					<p>Ms. Rejali states that: “I’m very glad to have this opportunity to work at the REJALI LAW FIRM and that she is very proud of her son Omid who has motivated and helped her through her journey.”</p>

					<p>Ms. Rejali is fluent in English and Farsi, and is proficient in Italian. When not working Ms. Rejali enjoys being around her family, reading and cooking.</p>
